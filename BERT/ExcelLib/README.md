XLL Development Files
=====================

Building the project requires two files from the [Microsoft Excel
Developer's Toolkit Version 15.0] [1].  These are subject to license
and not included in source distributions.  

Download the Excel SDK and put these two files in here (or somewhere the
compiler can find them):

XLCALL32.h  
XLCALL32.cpp
