
Basic Excel R Toolkit (BERT)
============================

Overview
--------

BERT is a new project to act as a generic R-Excel bridge for 
some future development.  It should embed R, ideally from a 
clean source dir (or binary from a separate build), and expose
some symbols to Excel.

The output should be a basic, generic DLL which we can reuse
in later projects.  Include, not extend.  Maybe.

Requirements
------------

 * Build targets for 32- and 64-bit Excel, both 2007/2010 and 2013

Explicit Non-Requirements
-------------------------

 * No support for Excel 2003 or previous
