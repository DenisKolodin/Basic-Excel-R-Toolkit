
Base Excel R Toolkit (BERT)
===========================

Overview
--------

Bert is a new project to act as a generic R-Excel bridge for 
some future development.  It should embed R, ideally from a 
clean source dir (or binary from a separate build), and expose
some symbols to Excel.

Requirements
------------

 * Build targets for 32- and 64-bit Excel, both 2007 and 2013

Explicit Non-Requirements
-------------------------

 * No support for Excel 2003 or previous
